                                             Explanation of pong
User story/ Gameplay: 

Gameplay - Two players will play a game of "ping pong" where they both have a paddle and will take turns hitting 
a ball. Each player that hits the ball pass the other's paddle gets a point. If the ball goes pass a player's 
paddle, they lose a point. Once a player's points reaches 11 they win.

The game begins when whichever one of the player's who has the ball hits it to start the competition.

The game will end when a player's score reaches 11.

I don't know what "ifs" will there be yet.





Visual game components:

There will be the board, two paddles, a ball, and a scoreboard.
    The board will be static.
    The paddles, ball, and scoreboard will be animated.

The data I need will be the points, the position for X and Y, as well as the speed for X and Y.





Events / logic:

Events that will occur in this game will be keyboard events and timer events.

The timer event will start a timer and the keyboard events will control the movement of my program by using 
keycodes and positions.

The timer event happens at the start of the game so both players start at the same time/ time the rounds 
and the keyboard events can control the up an down movements for the paddles.

There will also be a collision detector that checks to see if there is collision between the ball and paddles
similar to bouncing box where if the box would try to go out of bounds it would bounce the box back but instead
for this game the ball will bounce of the paddles of each player until one or the other scores/wins.
